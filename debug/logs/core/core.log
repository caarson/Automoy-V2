2025-07-18 22:28:08,031 - Automoy - AsyncOperationsThread - INFO - formulate_objective returned: objective_text=Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user's goal is to "Open Google Chrome by clicking the icon." I need to turn this into a detailed and actionable objective.

First, the original goal is pretty straightforward, but maybe it's too vague. The user wants to open Chrome by clicking its icon. But how exactly should that be done? The task might involve locating the Chrome icon on the desktop or in the Start menu, then clicking it. 

Wait, the example given in the instructions mentions things like specifying locations, actions, and details. For instance, when the user wanted to book a flight, the objective included specifics like departure date, return date, etc. So applying that here, maybe I need to break down the steps.

But the user's goal is just opening Chrome by clicking the icon. However, the assistant needs to make it actionable for UI interactions. So perhaps the objective should include finding the Chrome icon on the desktop, then performing a click. Alternatively, if the icon is in the Start menu, that might be another step. But since the user didn't specify where the icon is, maybe I need to assume common locations like the desktop or taskbar.

Wait, the example for summarizing news included opening a browser, searching, etc. So maybe here, the objective should detail locating the Chrome icon (on desktop or taskbar), then clicking it. Also, considering that on some systems, the icon might be in the Start menu, but perhaps the user expects it to be on the desktop. 

So the formulated objective needs to be specific. Let me check the example again. The user goal was "book a flight to paris" and the response included details like round-trip, location, dates, etc. Similarly, for opening Chrome, maybe I need to specify where the icon is located (desktop or taskbar) and the action of clicking it. But the original goal doesn't mention location, so perhaps the objective should assume that the icon is on the desktop or in the Start menu. However, since the user didn't specify, maybe the safest way is to describe the general steps: locate the Google Chrome icon on the desktop or taskbar and click it to launch the browser.

Alternatively, if the user's goal is just to open Chrome by clicking the icon regardless of location, but the assistant needs to make it actionable. So perhaps the objective should be "Locate the Google Chrome icon on the desktop or taskbar, then perform a left-click to launch the browser." But maybe even more specific, like "Click the Google Chrome icon located on the desktop to open the browser."

Wait, the user might have the icon in different places, so maybe it's better to mention both possibilities. However, the original goal is very general. The assistant needs to make sure that the objective is actionable through UI interactions. So perhaps the correct approach is to detail the steps as: "Locate and click the Google Chrome application icon on the desktop or taskbar to initiate the browser." That way, it's specific and actionable.

Alternatively, if the user has the icon in the Start menu, but that might vary. But since the user didn't specify, maybe the objective should just say "Click the Google Chrome icon" without specifying location, assuming that the UI can handle locating it. However, the examples provided earlier included details like "current location," so maybe including the location is necessary.

Hmm, perhaps the answer should be: "Open the Google Chrome browser by clicking its application icon on the desktop or taskbar." That's concise and specific. Alternatively, if the user might have the icon in the Start menu, but since the original goal doesn't specify, it's safer to assume common locations like desktop or taskbar.

I think that's the way to go. The objective should be detailed enough to guide the AI through the steps of locating and clicking the icon.
