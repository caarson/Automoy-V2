# What is Automoy-V2?
The project is originally derived from [Self-Operating Computer by OthersideAI](https://github.com/OthersideAI/self-operating-computer). Automoy extends on this API and makes deploying an autonomous agent easy.

This version utilizes **GPU acceleration** for OCR and object recognition tasks.

Automoy is built for **Deepseek, Ollama, and GPT**. Currently, **Claude and Gemini are not supported**, though this may change as the project evolves.

Version two integrates **Microsoft's OmniParser** for enhanced UI analysis and automation.

## How Does Automoy Function?
Automoy operates using **computer vision**, meaning it analyzes received images, extracts meaningful data, and executes logical actions to achieve an objective.

Currently, Automoy is designed for **computer automation**, but it will expand into **robotics** as the API matures and computer vision improves. Future iterations aim to support **real-time frame analysis**, enabling seamless interactions.

---

## Prerequisites
Automoy requires a **GPU with at least 2GB of VRAM**, along with **at least 4GB of free system RAM**. If the system relies on RAM caching, performance will be **significantly slower**. 

🔹 **Recommended system specifications:**  
- **Minimum:** 8GB system RAM (with swap space)  
- **Optimal:** 16GB system RAM for smooth performance  

🔹 **CUDA Requirement:**  
Automoy relies on **CUDA for GPU acceleration**. Before use, the application will verify:
1. **CUDA is properly configured**.
2. **The corresponding PyTorch package is installed**.

If CUDA is missing or misconfigured, **the program will not start**.

🚀 **Tested on:** CUDA **12.4**  
❓ **Older CUDA versions:** May be compatible but remain untested. Feedback is appreciated!

🔹 **Supported Operating Systems:**  
- **Windows 10+ only (official support).**  
- **Other OS (Linux/macOS) might work with minor modifications, but are untested.**

## Running CUDA on AMD GPUs (Experimental)
While Automoy natively supports **NVIDIA CUDA**, there are **alternative toolchains** for AMD GPUs:

🔹 **SCALE Toolkit** (Run CUDA directly on AMD GPUs):

🔹 **ZLUDA Toolkit** (Translates CUDA to AMD/Intel APIs):

## Future Plans
🚀 **Automated installation & configuration** (including AMD GPU support) is planned, but Automoy remains **human-developed**, so expect slower iterations. 

For now, **users must manually install prerequisites**. Thank you for your patience!
